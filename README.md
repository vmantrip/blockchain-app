# 🧱 Simple Blockchain in Python

This is a basic implementation of a **Blockchain** using Python and Flask. It simulates a minimal blockchain ledger where new blocks can be mined, transactions can be added, and the chain can be viewed through a RESTful API. This project is ideal for learning the fundamentals of blockchain technology.

## 🚀 Features

- Add and broadcast transactions
- Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm
- Block mining with rewards
- Retrieve the full blockchain
- Simple REST API built with Flask

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Flask (for API)
- Hashlib (SHA-256)
- UUID (for unique node IDs)
- JSON

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-python-blockchain.git
   cd simple-python-blockchain


pip install Flask


python blockchain.py
